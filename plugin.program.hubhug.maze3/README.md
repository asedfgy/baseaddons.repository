===========================

Monster Battle Wins/Losses are not currently setup.

When Life hits 0, you loose and you exit from the game automatically.
When you hit the EXIT / END, the game will automatically start another level.

You can only pass a DOOR when you have 1 or more key(s).  A key is used up every time you use one to pass through a door.  What can I say, they break EASILY!

Please note that there are Sound FX(s) in this game.  So adjust volume settings accordingly in XBMC and/or your OS.
