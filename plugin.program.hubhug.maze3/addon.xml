  	<description>Originally a MAZE-type game, this has become a full-on dungeon/adventure game.  There's still maze-like maps with a starting location and a location to exit from.  You can use the exit on a map to goto another map, carrying over what you've picked up.  This is unless you want a final victory, then save your beloved and take her to the exit.</description>
